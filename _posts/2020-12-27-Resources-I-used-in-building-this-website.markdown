description: Some resources I used and lessons I learned from building this website
---

At the beginning of this Christmas break, I decided to build my personal website. This is a long overdue project, which I have been thinking of for a while but didn't have a whole block of time to really finish it. Actually, it took me only less than a day to put the information of teaching, publications, sotware and presentations into different markdowns. But I spent about two days to understand the structure of the theme I am using, what are [sass](https://sass-lang.com/guide) files, where to change headers or add navigation links etc. After building this website, I think I should write down my learning process, especially, the resources that I used. So if in the future I were going to build a new website, I could come back to this post and find them easier.

I have seen many personal websites that are build with Github Pages, so I think it should be the way to go. Then I googled how to build an academic website, and learned about [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) from Rob William's post on [Building an Academic Website](https://jayrobwilliams.com/posts/2020/06/academic-website/). I scanned both Hugo themes and Jekyll themes, and eventually decided to use the [indigo](https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo) theme with Jekyll. I like how it looks simple, yet have the ability to put different group of information on different pages. However, I found that this theme does  not come with a detailed documentation for users.
